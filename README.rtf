For this project I created a template binary search tree. It reads data in from a file and inserts it onto my tree. My project is templated to work for both integers and strings (series of chars). There are a number of public interfaces: insert(Type), printInOrder(), printPostOrder(), printPreOrder(), find(Type), delete(Type), deleteAll(), and load(filename). I believe that I properly managed my memory allocating and decollating each pointer.
